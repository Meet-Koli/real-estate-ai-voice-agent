# real-estate-ai-voice-agent
AI-powered real estate assistant demo showcasing conversational property search, lead qualification, and automation workflows. Actively under development.

## 🔊 Voice-Based Property Search (Demo Implemented)

✅ Successfully implemented a **voice-enabled property search flow**.

The agent can:
- Accept **spoken user queries**
- Normalize inputs (location, budget, intent)
- Match properties by **city, budget, bedrooms, and property type**
- Return filtered results via an automated workflow

This focuses on a **simple but complete search branch**, showcasing how a real estate AI agent can handle end-to-end voice interactions.

### 🧠 Workflow Overview

The following workflow demonstrates the implemented **Search Properties** branch, including:
- Input normalization
- Intent-based search
- Attribute filtering (city, budget, bedrooms, property type)
- Response aggregation and delivery
